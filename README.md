# weatherapp
To get live weather for a searched location, use a weather API like OpenWeatherMap. Take user input (city name), send a fetch request to the API with your API key, and receive JSON data. Extract details like temperature, condition, and location, then display them using JavaScript. You must sign up for a free API key.
